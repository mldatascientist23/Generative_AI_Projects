# üé¨ Movie Query and Recommendation System üçø

This Streamlit app allows users to query and get recommendations for movies based on a provided description. The app uses a pre-uploaded CSV file containing movie details, generates embeddings for the movie summaries, and retrieves the most relevant movie based on user input using cosine similarity. The application also provides additional context using the Groq API.

## Features

- **Upload CSV File:** Upload a CSV file with movie details, including columns like `Title`, `Year`, `Rating`, `Summary`, `Movie Poster`, and `YouTube Trailer`.
- **Movie Query:** Enter a description or query related to a movie, and the app will return the most similar movie from the database.
- **Movie Details:** Get detailed information about the retrieved movie, including the title, year, rating, summary, movie poster, and a link to the YouTube trailer.
- **Integration with Groq API:** Uses the Groq API to provide additional context and insights based on the retrieved movie details.
